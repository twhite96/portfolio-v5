This was another beginner project taking the Wikipedia API so that when a user searched for a term on Wikipedia, a list of search results would be populated immediately and then take the user to Wikipedia to read the article. As an added User Story, I added a *Rando Wiki* button to grab a random Wikipedia article for the user using that specific API parameter.
