# **About Me**

Hi 👋🏾! I'm **{{ site.author.name }}**, a frontend engineer formerly at **[REDACTED]** working remotely in my comfy little apartment in Swatara Twp, PA. I have been programming as an autodidact and university student for three years. I attended the University of Pittsburgh for two years after a stint in a few junior colleges.

I'm currently looking for work so if you have a remote position for a junior/mid-level dev please reach out!

My toolbox contains JavaScript, React, some Rails, and Styled Components 💅.
